= eslog

Lightweight, structured logger for Go projects. It basically adds some functions to slog which I found missing (e.g. log*f functions and a logFatal function known from standard log package.). Slog is wrapped inside eslog so you can do everything which is possible with slog.

NOTE: This project is intended to not have any dependencies.
